# keybiner
Entitlements compression and validation library. Clients / services can leverage the Keyabiner library for Authorization information compression, decompression and authorization check as well.

Reference service can configured as JVM property or environment property with key name **authcode.service.URL**. Reference service response should match with following json format.
````
[
   {
      "REFID":"ABF NAME"
   }

            String entitlementsJson = EntitlementPack.encodeEntilementJson(s);
            String compressed = Compression.compress(entitlementsJson);
````

We can use Keyabiner library to get an encoded and compressed String of the above JSON message. 
````
            entitlementsJson = Compression.decompressToString(compressed);
            Entitlements entitlements = EntitlementPack.decodeEntitlement(entitlementsJson);
````
When a client / service receives a token, it uses the following method to perform an authorization check.
````
Authorizer.isAuthorized("987654320", null, entitlements, new String[]{"PUSH_FEES_TO_BILL"})
````
The Keyabiner library can be used/extended for any purpose not just for authorization. Have Fun!!
